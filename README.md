## Features
## variables

1. Variables
    Variables store data that can be used and manipulated in a program. In JavaScript, you can declare variables using var, let, or const.
  - Understanding JavaScript Variables (`let`, `const`, `var`)
  - let: Allows you to reassign values but is block-scoped.
  - const: A constant variable that cannot be reassigned.
  - var: Older way of declaring variables, function-scoped (not recommended in modern JavaScript).

## Function

2. Functions
    Functions allow you to group reusable code.
  - Functions and Arrow Functions

## Conditional Statements

3. Conditional Statements
    Conditional statements allow you to make decisions in your code. Based on the conditions that are evaluated to either true or false, the code will branch to different paths.
  - Conditional Statements (`if-else`, `switch`)
  - if Statement
       * The if statement evaluates a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true.
  - if-else Statement
       * The if-else statement allows you to specify an alternative block of code if the condition is false.
  - else if Statement
       * The else if statement allows you to check multiple conditions sequentially.
  - switch Statement
       * The switch statement is an alternative to multiple if-else if conditions when you're comparing a variable to 
         several values
## Getting Started

To run the JavaScript examples, open `example.js` in your favorite code editor and run it using Node.js or a web browser console.
